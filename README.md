# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! 👨‍💻

This repo is a personal collection of solutions to LeetCode problems that I solve either daily or whenever I get the chance. It's meant to help me track my progress, revisit tough problems, and serve as a reference for future practice.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

leetcode-solutions/ ├── #1/ │ └── two-sum.py ├── #2/ │ └── add-two-numbers.py ├── #3/ │ └── longest-substring-without-repeating-characters.py ...


- Each top-level directory is named with the format `#<problem-number>`.
- Inside each directory, the solution is written in Python and named using the problem title in **kebab-case**.

## ✅ Goals
- Stay consistent with daily problem-solving.
- Improve problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.
- Build a handy archive of clean, readable Python solutions.

## 🚀 How to Use
Feel free to browse the solutions and use them for learning and reference. Each solution is designed to be simple, well-commented, and easy to understand.

> ⚠️ **Note:** These solutions are for educational purposes. If you're currently taking part in contests or applying for jobs, make sure you truly understand the solutions before using them.
